<div class="section">Summary</div>
<p>The goal of this project is to implement a fast key-value store in GPU memory 
based on a (possibly modified) b-tree data structure.</p>

<div class="section">Background</div>
<p>Key-value data stores are an essential part of many applications and they have 
recently been brough back under the spotlight by the NoSQL movement.</p>
<p>The b-tree is an old but very interesting data structure which was originally
developed to reduce the amount of disk traffic back when main memory was a very
scarce resource. Since then it has been the focus of much research and many variants
have been designed, some focused on cache access patterns, others on concurrency, ...</p>
<p>However, despite the hunt for ever more scalability in databases, there have been
relatively little work on using this venerable data structure in a GPGPU setting.
I intend to remedy to this sad state of affairs and implement a fast key-value store
that will achieve significant speedup by processing queries in batches.</p>

<div class="section">Challenge</div>
<p>Like all tree structures, the b-tree present many challenges for effective
GPU parallelization as it involves significant indirection as well as conditional
control flow. In addition, there is potential for high contention during tree
rebalancing.</p>
<p>The hope here is that the complexity of implementing insertion and removal will
be largely offset by the gains from the lookups.</p>

<div class="section">Resources</div>
<p>I will do most of the prototyping on my laptop, using a venerable GeForce 9500M GS 
(Compute 1.1) and performance testing on the GTX 480 of the Gates cluster. This way
I will have a solution that is able to take advantage of commodity hardware and
performance figures that can be compared to typical research papers on GPGPU.</p>
<p>All the work will be done from scratch.</p>

<div class="section">Goals/Deliverables</div>
<ul>
    <li>Design a variant of the b-tree structure that is suitable for use on a GPU
    <li>Implement it using CUDA (75% goal : read-only structure)
    <li>Create some benchmarks that demonstrate the strength and weaknesses of this
    data structure
    <li><b>[stretch]</b>Match (or exceed) the throughput of state-of-the-art implementations
    of similar data structures
    <li><b>[stretch]</b>Come up with a cool demo
    <li><b>[stretch]</b>Wrap the code in a nice library and Open Source it
</ul>

<div class="section">Platform</div>
<p>High throughput key-value stores are a cornerstone of many "Big Data" applications.
People have gone to great length to optimize such data structures first using SIMD,
then multiple cores and finally multiple nodes in a network. Leveraring the power of
GPUs could lead to significant improvement in the scalability for a fairly modest
cost.</p>
